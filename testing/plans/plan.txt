Each flight needs:

        From
                Coords
                REQUIRED
        To
                Coords
                REQUIRED
        Airline
                OPTIONAL
        Flight no.
                OPTIONAL
        Date
                OPTIONAL
        Path on map
                TODO: How do this?
                PROGRAM CALCULATES



Tech:
        Need to store the flight data on a database (see tutorial from few
        months back)

        Host the database on a server either built with next.js, or python
        (django/flask)
